# 🤖 CHIP-8 Emulator

## 🌟 Overview

Welcome to my CHIP-8 Emulator project! This is a project to emulate the classic CHIP-8 environment using modern C++20. The reasons for building this simulator are to go deeper into CPU architectures, to implement first-hand a cycle-by-cycle simulator and to have fun!

With this emulator, you can run vintage CHIP-8 games and programs. 

## ✨ Features

- 🚀 Full implementation of the CHIP-8 instruction set.
- 🛠️ Modular design for easy maintenance and extension.
- 🐛 Debug and 🚀 Release build configurations.

## 📋 Prerequisites

Before you start, make sure you have the following installed:

- **CMake** (version 3.0 or higher) 📦
- **Clang** (or another C++20 compatible compiler, but you will need to modify the CMakeLists.txt) 🛠️
